# Logical Equivalence

Now that we've covered that we can make very large tables that show all the possible outcomes of a logical statement, we can get into a new concept: Equivalence.  This is a fancy mathy way of saying that if you have two statements with the same outputs, they are interchangable.

A more formal definition would be:
> Two statements $p$ and $q$ are said to be logically equivalent, or $p \equiv q$, if and only if $p \leftrightarrow q$ is a [tautology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautology_\(logic\)).

However, that definition has a lot that we haven't covered, so let's break it down one step at a time:

- A tautology is a statement where $p \leftrightarrow q$ always outputs `true`.
